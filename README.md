# Counting-Program
You enter what number you want it to count to and the number that you want it to count by and it will display the current datetime then count to the number that you entered by the other number you entered and then displays the current datetime so you can view how long it took for it to count. It can print approximately 10,000 numbers a second depending on a Rasberry Pi, 10 per second on a Macbook.
Note: I used Mu on the Raspberry Pi and Python IDLE on the Macbook.
Comment down below if you want to help and want me to make you a collaborater.
Note: If you delete or do other things in the danger zone without my permission, I have the file on my laptop so don't even think about trying it.
